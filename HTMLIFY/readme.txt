2Q. When I go into CSS and type  chosencode{Property: change;} it doesnt work.
																	   See class="button1"				
2A. That is because there is a class on each piece of code that in generated for example if you chose button then you would type .button1{Property: change;} you would type this because <button class="button1"> you can change "button1" to anything then you would type .chosenclass{Property: change;}
